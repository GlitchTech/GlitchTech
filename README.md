Since I first learned how to use a computer as a kid, I’ve been breaking and fixing them. In my early teens, I learned about Java and programming for the web. In the 15+ years since then, I’ve created dozens of software solutions for the web, mobile devices, and embedded electronics.

I taught myself more than a dozen programming languages and added many frameworks to my skill set since my first taste of writing code. Creating programs and websites led me to the Maker movement. By combining programming with my physical crafting skills, I now build custom software, electronics, costumes, props, and whatever else I want or need. I even exhibited at Maker Faire KC a few times.

When I bought my first smartphone in 2009, I discovered that it didn’t have any financial tracking apps. I wasn’t surprised, since it was a webOS Palm Pre, and its mobile ecosystem was brand new. Before the official Palm app store opened, I built and released Checkbook to the Homebrew developer community. Eventually the app made its way into the official store. During the short lifespan of webOS, Checkbook accumulated almost 20,000 paid downloads.

Outside of tech, I spend my time reading, writing, and playing D&D.
